# InFlow

InFlow is agentic commerce infrastructure. It gives Agents and Services a common toolchain for
discovery, enrollment, authentication, and payments across MPP and x402.

The InFlow command-line interface gives Agents one entry point for discovering Services, navigating
their Offerings, establishing credentials, and paying protected endpoints. The InFlow software
development kits let applications integrate the same Buyer and Seller workflows directly in
Node.js, Go, Python, and Rust.

## How InFlow works

1. An Agent discovers a relevant Service and the Offerings it exposes.
2. The Agent enrolls when the Service requires identity, claims, or a reusable credential.
3. The Agent invokes a protected Action through MPP or x402.
4. InFlow coordinates authentication, approval, payment, and the resulting receipt.

Services can integrate either payment protocol without replacing their application or catalog.
Agents use a consistent interface while each Service retains control of its access and payment
requirements.

## Open protocol ecosystem

InFlow brings together three complementary layers:

- [Offering Discovery Protocol](https://github.com/offering-protocol) defines how Agents discover
  Services and navigate Collections, Offerings, and Actions.
- [Agent Enrollment Protocol](https://github.com/aep-foundation) defines how Agents establish an
  identity and credential relationship with Services.
- MPP and x402 define how Agents pay protected HTTP endpoints.

Each layer can be adopted independently. Together they support a complete flow from discovery to
enrollment and payment.
